![Banner](./image/banner.png)

Some source code from the time when I was studying computer science and already spent a good part of my evenings and weekends behind the computer.

At that time, it was mostly Turbo Pascal and PC assembler.

These source codes were published on CD-ROM and were somehow retrieved by [SWAG - SourceWare Archive Group](http://swag.delphidabbler.com/).

If we search about `SWAG` and `PASCAL` on f.i. GitHub, we can also retrieve an [archive here](https://github.com/ncabanes/swag-pascal)
